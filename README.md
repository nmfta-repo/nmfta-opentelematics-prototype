This repo contains the following 3 components of a working prototype implementation of [Open Telematics API](https://github.com/nmfta-repo/nmfta-opentelematics-api) (OTAPI) version [0.1rc4](https://github.com/nmfta-repo/nmfta-opentelematics-api/releases/tag/proto-0.1rc4).
1. A bridge server. Converting from tables of an existing TSP and serving OTAPI data. See `Prototype.Telematics.BridgeServer`
2. Client libraries written around the SDK automatically-generated by apimatic from the 0.1rc4 specification. See `Client/python`
3. A webserver UI demonstrating application of OTAPI to simple backend integrations. See `Client/python/otapiui`

Within 3. it also contains an implementation of the SEFL '57 fault' predictive vehicle maintenance heuristics.

# Using the Prototype

1) The Prototype.Telematics.BridgeServer database project has all the SQL Scripts to setup the SQL Server Database
2) To Initialize the database 
  a) Create a new SQL Server Database called OpenTelematics <= The Prototype Database was tested in SQL Server 2017
  b) Execute scripts under Tables, Stored Procedures and Data folders
3) The Prototype OTAPI was implemented with ASP.NET Core 2.2
4) Open nmfta-opentelematics-prototype.sln n Visual Studio 2019
5) Check the Connection and API Launch settings in launchSettngs.json and appsettings.json
6) Set the Default Project to Prototype.OpenTelematics.Api
7) Launch API Server by Pressing F5 (Debug) or CTRL+F5 (Start without Debug)
